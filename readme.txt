### Update 23.04.2020
I implemented a GUI via tk
Version used: Python 3.7.4


This is a simple python made chess game to run in the console (chess.py) or via GUI (see chess_GUI.py).
You can move by typing eg. "b2 d4". 

I am new into coding and started this project to practice. 
Since I know its far away from perfect I decided to upload it anyawys to get a step into github
and to present my first little project to the world.

Happy appreciate feedback!
