### Update 23.04.2020
I implemented a GUI via TKinter
Version used: Python 3.7.4
Requirements: TKinter


This is a simple python made chess game to run in the console (chess.py). 
You can move by typing eg. "b2 d4". 

Or you can alos play via GUI (see chess_GUI.py).

I am new into coding and started this project to practice. 
Since I know its far away from perfect I decided to upload it anyawys to get a step into github
and to present my first little project to the world.

Happy appreciate feedback!
